-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

-Target activity-
You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

-Steps-
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.
2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.
For each claim, extract the following information:
- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type
- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.
- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.
- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
