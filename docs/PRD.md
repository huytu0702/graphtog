# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Document Processing and Q&A System with Tree of Graphs (ToG) and LangGraph Agent

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
Knowledge Graph-based Document Processing and Q&A System with Tree of Graphs, LangGraph Agent and LangSmith Tracing

### 1.2 Executive Summary
This product is a web-based application that allows users to upload documents, process them through Microsoft's GraphRAG methodology enhanced with Tree of Graphs (ToG) reasoning from the outset, and generate intelligent answers to user queries. The system will utilize a knowledge graph (Neo4j) to store relationships between entities extracted from documents and a PostgreSQL database to store user data. The integration of ToG methodology will enhance reasoning capabilities by structuring the problem-solving process as a tree of interconnected graph-based reasoning steps. The system will be built using a LangGraph agent that intelligently selects the optimal retrieval strategy (GraphRAG, ToG, or Hybrid) based on the query type and provides transparent reasoning chains with LangSmith tracing for enhanced debugging and monitoring.

## 6. Microsoft GraphRAG with Tree of Graphs (ToG) Implementation

### 6.1 Overview
Microsoft's GraphRAG approach combines traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge graph technology to enhance the quality and relevance of generated answers. When enhanced with Tree of Graphs (ToG) reasoning, the system structures the problem-solving process as a tree of interconnected graph-based reasoning steps, allowing for more sophisticated and structured analysis of complex queries.

### 6.2 ToG Integration Details
The Tree of Graphs approach will enable the system to:
1. Break complex queries into smaller sub-problems (tree nodes)
2. Process each sub-problem using graph-based reasoning
3. Combine results from multiple reasoning paths
4. Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously with backtracking when needed
5. Provide explainable AI by showing the reasoning path

### 6.3 Implementation Steps
1. **Document Parsing**: Extract text, images, and structured data from uploaded documents
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identify and classify entities (people, places, organizations, concepts)
3. **Relationship Extraction**: Determine relationships between identified entities
4. **Graph Construction**: Create a knowledge graph representation of document content
5. **Indexing**: Index the knowledge graph for efficient querying
6. **Query Decomposition**: Break complex queries into sub-queries using ToG methodology
7. **Tree-based Reasoning**: Execute reasoning across multiple graph paths simultaneously
8. **Result Aggregation**: Combine insights from multiple reasoning paths
9. **Answer Generation**: Generate responses based on graph insights using Gemini 2.5 Flash

### 6.4 Knowledge Graph Schema with ToG Capabilities
The Neo4j knowledge graph will include nodes for:
- Documents
- Entities (People, Organizations, Places, Concepts)
- Sentences/Paragraphs
- Topics/Themes
- Reasoning Steps
- ToG Nodes (tree structure for reasoning paths)

Relationships will include:
- CONTAINS, REFERS_TO, MENTIONS, CONNECTS_TO
- HAS_TYPE, PART_OF, RELATED_TO
- REASONING_STEP_OF, PREVIOUS_STEP, NEXT_STEP
- SUB_PROBLEM_OF, DEPENDS_ON

### 6.5 ToG Reasoning Process
The ToG reasoning will follow these steps:
1. **Query Analysis**: Analyze the question to determine if ToG reasoning is needed
2. **Problem Decomposition**: Break the query into sub-problems if complexity threshold is exceeded
3. **Tree Construction**: Create reasoning tree with multiple paths
4. **Parallel Exploration**: Traverse multiple graph paths simultaneously
5. **Result Synthesis**: Combine results from all exploration paths
6. **Validation**: Verify consistency and accuracy of final answer
7. **Explanation**: Generate reasoning path documentation

### 6.6 Flexible Query Modes with LangGraph Agent
The system will feature a LangGraph-based agent that automatically classifies question types and selects the most appropriate processing strategy:

#### 6.6.1 Query Mode Classification
- **Chế độ truy vấn linh hoạt (GraphRAG / ToG / Hybrid)**: The system will automatically classify question types and select the appropriate response strategy:
  - **GraphRAG Mode**: Applied when questions require a comprehensive, holistic view. The system will use the GraphRAG approach to search for answers based on the overall knowledge graph and community summaries.
  - **ToG Mode**: Applied when questions involve deep sequential queries or require step-by-step reasoning. The system will use the ToG method, starting from key entities and sequentially expanding through relationships, with pruning of irrelevant branches, to find detailed answers.
  - **Hybrid Mode**: Applied for complex multi-tiered questions that require both broad context and deep reasoning. The system combines both approaches: starting with GraphRAG to identify relevant knowledge areas, then switching to ToG to explore details within those areas.

#### 6.6.2 LangGraph Agent Workflow
- **Query Classification**: The agent analyzes incoming queries to determine the optimal processing strategy
- **Mode Selection**: Automatically selects between GraphRAG, ToG, or Hybrid based on query characteristics
- **Execution Orchestration**: Coordinates the execution of the chosen reasoning approach
- **Result Aggregation**: Combines results from various reasoning processes
- **Response Generation**: Creates final responses with appropriate citations and explanations

### 6.7 Reasoning Chain and Transparency Features
The system will provide enhanced transparency through detailed reasoning chains:

#### 6.7.1 Reasoning Chain Display
- **Each response will include**: The main answer (generated in natural Vietnamese by the LLM) and a reasoning chain explaining the logical steps or information links used to reach the answer.
- **Chain Visualization**: The reasoning chain can be displayed as a list of logical steps, with citations or annotations showing the source (e.g., from which document section or graph node).
- **Traceability**: Users will be able to understand the basis of the answer, increasing transparency and trust in the system.

#### 6.7.2 LangSmith Integration
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: All agent operations and reasoning steps will be traced using LangSmith
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Enhanced debugging and monitoring of the agent's decision-making process
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of agent performance and response quality
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all processing steps for compliance and optimization
